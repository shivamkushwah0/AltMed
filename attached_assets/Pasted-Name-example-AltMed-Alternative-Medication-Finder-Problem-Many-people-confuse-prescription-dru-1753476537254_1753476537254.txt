Name (example): AltMed ‚Äì Alternative Medication Finder Problem: Many people confuse prescription drugs with non-prescription (OTC) drugs. For certain conditions (like migraines, fungal infections, skin issues), effective over-the-counter alternatives exist ‚Äî but people don‚Äôt know about them. Information is scattered, and it's hard to find trustworthy, clear guidance. Solution: A mobile or web app where users can enter their symptoms and get over-the-counter (OTC) or non-prescription alternatives to commonly prescribed drugs. The app would suggest OTC products that have similar effects but are available without a prescription. üß† Core Features Symptom-based Search User types in symptoms like "migraine", "fungal infection", or "skin rash" The app shows commonly prescribed medications Then it recommends non-prescription alternatives that match those drugs in effect Alternative Comparison Tool Compare ingredients, effectiveness, side effects, usage instructions, and price For example: ‚ÄúIbuprofen vs. Naproxen‚Äù, ‚ÄúClotrimazole cream vs. prescription Terbinafine cream‚Äù Local Availability Use location to check if the product is in stock at nearby pharmacies Link to online pharmacies for purchase, if available Expert Review Information reviewed or verified by doctors or pharmacists for credibility üë§ Target Users Busy professionals (who don‚Äôt have time to go to the doctor) Health-conscious individuals (who want to understand what they‚Äôre taking) People with chronic conditions (looking for safe long-term options) Parents or caregivers (seeking safe, effective medications for their kids) üí° Example Use Case User: ‚ÄúI have a pounding headache. Is there something other than Tylenol I can take?‚Äù App: ‚ÄúFor migraines, doctors often prescribe Sumatriptan. However, available OTC alternatives include Advil Migraine (Ibuprofen) and Excedrin Migraine (Acetaminophen + Caffeine + Aspirin).‚Äù ‚Üí The app then shows ingredient comparison, usage tips, and where to buy it. ‚úÖ Expected Benefits Reduces unnecessary doctor visits Empowers users to manage minor health issues on their own Helps prevent misuse of medication Educates people about safe and effective OTC options
Make this app, so this is the overview of the app to make.
for building use react native to build the app so that I can use it in android as well as ios also, later on, make sure that the apis that the app will be hitting is written using some JS framework like ExpressJS, make sure that the database is mongodb, the easier the better, frontend is using react Native.
Now we need to see what APIs to make,
API to make find the medicines according to the complaints by patient, that complaint is telling us the issue patient has, Use a API call to LLM(gemini works) for this, this LLM will have use a particular prompt to send the data back as a json which will contain the medicine name, usage, whether prescription or non prescription drugs, and other related details needed to show the user.
Pharmacies nearby that has the medicine, this API will make a search operation on the database that contains all the stores data, with their geo location to find the distance from current location, and obvv availability of the medicine that will be given as an input
Fetch the user data from daatabase
Login API also
Now that was all about the APIs, for how the database will be created I have some idea
SO this is going to be a NOSQL database, we will be using MongoDB. We will have some different schemas like
User schema that will contain the personal and public details of a user. like name, age, email, phone number.
Store Schema, where a store can be added, name of the store, geo location of store, and then what medicines are available in how much quantities in the store.
All the medicines that are stored, and then the store Ids where this medicine is available, Also the image of this medicine, and other things needed
This seems like all that we will need for making this app. Make sure to make this app modular, backend as well as frontend, so that I can debug all the things whenever needed
